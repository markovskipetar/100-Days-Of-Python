#print("Strings are strings of characters"
#priint("String Concatenation is done with the + sign")
#print(("New lines can be created with a \ and the letter n")


print("Notes from Day 1") # missing opening quote
print("The print statement is used to output strings") #wrong indentation
print("Strings are strings of characters") # missing closing bracket
print("String Concatenation is done with the" + "sign") # typo in print and wrong usage of '+' sign
print("New lines can be created with a \ and the letter n") # extra opening bracket
print("New lines\n")
